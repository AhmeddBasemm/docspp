# create-idocs

Versions up to 0.2.0 were published as `create-docspp`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 73fc966: docspp is now **idocs**, and its home is [github.com/The-Package-Labs/idocs](https://github.com/The-Package-Labs/idocs). The diagram format is unchanged; only names change. To move a project over:
  
  - Replace the packages: `@packagelab/docspp-core`, `-react` and `-astro` become `@the-package-labs/idocs-core`, `-react` and `-astro`; the `docspp` CLI becomes `idocs`; `npm create docspp` becomes `npm create idocs`. Update `package.json`, the imports in `astro.config.mjs` and MDX pages, the `/// <reference types="@the-package-labs/idocs-astro/virtual" />` line and any `pnpm docspp` scripts.
  - Rename CSS overrides: the tokens are `--idocs-*` and the classes `.idocs` and `.idocs-*`.
  - Reinstall the agent skill with `npx skills add The-Package-Labs/idocs --skill idocs`; it is now called `idocs`.
  - Run `pnpm idocs schema` to rewrite `diagrams/diagram.schema.json`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- aa76c88: Add an `autoplay` prop to `<Diagram>` and `<DiagramView>`. It plays the scenario given by `scenario` as soon as the diagram is laid out, and is ignored when the reader prefers reduced motion. `<Diagram>` also accepts `hash`, which `<DiagramView>` already had: `hash={false}` stops the diagram writing the scenario and step into the page address, which suits decorative embeds.
  
  Fix icons going blank when the same logo appears twice on a page and the first copy is hidden (a tab that is not selected, "Hide planned"). Icon sets reuse gradient ids inside each logo, so the copies shared ids; every instance now has its own.
  
  Fix the playback speed picker keeping the browser's text colour, which made it unreadable when a diagram's palette is dark on a light site (or the other way round).
