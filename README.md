# idocs

**Architecture diagrams your readers can play.**

Describe a system in YAML. Get a clean, interactive diagram with markdown docs behind every box, and scenarios that show a request travelling through it, step by step.

## Why idocs

Architecture diagrams go stale because they are pictures. idocs keeps the system as data, so the diagram, the docs and the walkthroughs come from one place that lives in your repository and changes in the same pull request as the code.

- **Playground.** Write YAML with a live preview, or build nodes, groups and connections visually and export the YAML. Local drafts, undo/redo and examples included.
- **Declarative.** Nodes, groups and edges in `diagram.yaml`. No coordinates: layout is automatic and steerable with a few hints.
- **Scenarios.** Any number per diagram: the happy path, a cache miss, a declined card. Each plays as packets over the architecture, as a sequence diagram, or as a swimlane story, with a step list, scrubbing, speed control and shareable deep links.
- **One model, many views.** Write a node once; show it in an overview, a backend-only view, a per-team view.
- **Docs inside the picture.** Click a box for its markdown, connections and source references. Edge keys link to an interfaces table generated from the model.
- **Icons.** Brand logos for your stack (`postgresql`, `redis`, `keycloak`…), [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) for the rest, and your own SVGs. Embedded in published diagrams; the playground loads its bundled catalog from the same site.
- **A real docs site.** Astro and Starlight: markdown pages, search, light and dark themes, static output you can host anywhere, GitHub Pages included.
- **Written to be generated.** A JSON Schema for your editor, a CLI whose errors say `file:line:col` and suggest fixes, and a skill that teaches AI agents the format.

## Quick start

You need Node 22 or newer.

```sh
npm create idocs@latest my-docs
cd my-docs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the address it prints, then edit `diagrams/shop/diagram.yaml`. Save, and the page reloads.

```yaml
nodes:
  browser: { kind: client, title: Browser }
  api:     { kind: service, icon: nodejs, title: API, sub: ":3000" }
  db:      { kind: database, icon: postgresql, title: Database }

edges:
  - browser -> api: HTTPS
  - api -> db: { kind: data, label: SQL }

scenarios:
  load-page:
    title: Load a page
    steps:
      - browser -> api: GET /items
      - api -> db: { label: SELECT, kind: lookup }
      - db -> api: rows
      - api -> browser: 200 OK
```

That is a diagram with three boxes, two connections and one scenario a reader can play. The [getting started guide](https://the-package-labs.github.io/idocs/guides/getting-started/) goes on from here.

### Check your work

```sh
pnpm check                  # validate every diagram; errors point at file:line:col
pnpm idocs check --strict  # treat warnings as errors, for CI
```

The site's source is in [`apps/docs`](apps/docs); add a page there in the same pull request as the change it documents.

## Use it with an AI agent

```sh
npx skills add The-Package-Labs/idocs --skill idocs
```

The [skills](https://skills.sh) installer puts the **idocs skill** into your project for Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot and other agents. It knows how to set idocs up, the whole diagram format, how to write scenarios and stories, and how to fix layout and errors. Projects from the starter template already include it. The skill lives in [`skills/idocs`](skills/idocs).

## Use it in VS Code

The [VS Code extension](extensions/vscode) highlights diagram files, checks them as you type, completes node ids and icon names, renames ids everywhere, and shows the diagram in a **live preview** beside the file, following your cursor. See [Use it in VS Code](https://the-package-labs.github.io/idocs/guides/editor/).

## Packages

Everything here is published to npm and versioned together. The VS Code extension is released separately.

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`create-idocs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-idocs) | `npm create idocs`: scaffolds a project from the starter template |
| [`idocs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idocs) | the command line: `check`, `list`, `schema`, `icons search` and `new` |
| [`@packagelab/idocs-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@packagelab/idocs-core) | schema, compiler, layout, edge router, scenario timeline. The main entry is browser-safe |
| [`@packagelab/idocs-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@packagelab/idocs-react) | the `DiagramView` component and its styles |
| [`@packagelab/idocs-astro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@packagelab/idocs-astro) | the Astro integration and the `<Diagram>` component |

## How it works

```
 diagram.yaml ─┐
 nodes/*.md ───┼─▶  compile  ─▶  layout  ─▶  render
 scenarios/ ───┘    (validate)    (ELK +      (React, SVG,
                                   router)     pan and zoom)
```

1. **Compile.** The YAML is validated against a [zod](https://zod.dev) schema and normalised into a JSON-serialisable model. Mistakes are reported with file, line and column.
2. **Layout.** Groups are laid out bottom up with [ELK](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs), and a small A\* router draws the orthogonal edges between them.
3. **Render.** A React component draws the result and plays scenarios. The timeline and the story model are pure functions of the compiled diagram, so what you see at any step is reproducible.

The Astro integration does the compile step at build time, so readers download a static page.

## Repository layout

A monorepo: the tool, its documentation and its starter project change together.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`packages/`](packages) | `core`, `react`, `astro`, `cli` and `create-idocs` |
| [`extensions/vscode`](extensions/vscode) | the VS Code extension: grammar, language features and the live preview |
| [`apps/docs`](apps/docs) | the landing page, guides and live examples (also the end-to-end tests) |
| [`templates/starter`](templates/starter) | the project new users start from |
| [`skills/idocs`](skills/idocs) | the agent skill |
| [`scripts/`](scripts) | build, template and release tooling |
| [`docs/`](docs) | design notes: [PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) and [REPOSITORIES.md](docs/REPOSITORIES.md) |

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # the docs site, http://localhost:4321
pnpm dev:template     # the starter project
pnpm test             # unit tests
pnpm test:e2e         # builds the docs and drives them in Chrome (needs Google Chrome)
pnpm verify:pack      # packs everything and installs it the way a user would
pnpm vscode:test      # the VS Code extension, inside a real VS Code
pnpm lint             # Biome
pnpm typecheck
```

Needs Node 22 or newer and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full workflow, and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) holds the rules for working on the tool with an AI agent.

## Roadmap

Where idocs is heading, roughly in order. The reasoning is in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).

- [ ] Automated releases from the main branch
- [ ] More diagram types: state machines and entity relationships
- [ ] Forked scenarios (a step that branches into outcomes)
- [ ] Visual regression tests for layout
- [ ] Export to SVG, PNG and GIF
- [ ] Layout in a web worker for very large diagrams
- [ ] Import from Mermaid and OpenAPI
- [ ] An MCP server for agents
